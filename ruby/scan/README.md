# General

This script is used to scan documents currently from a Canon DR Scanner.
Alternatively _gscan2pdf_ is used, but in combination with _pdfmd_ this is faster.

# Requirements

_Thor_ has been used to implement the command structure.

# Usage

1. Copy the script into your path (with a different name, maybe?).
2. Make is executeable.
3. Run the command everywhere. Without parameters the help will be displayed.
